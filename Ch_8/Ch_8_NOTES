This chapter addresses  two scenarios: 
    - using multiple GPUs from a single host thread  and
    - using MPI where each MPI process uses a separate GPU.

N.B.: Although I have compiled and run all the files in the repo, note that I do not have more than 1 GPU on my 
      machine (donations gladly accepted to remedy this situation!!!). In spite of this, I have decided to include the 
      examples from this chapter as I think they are of particular interest (the MPI examples for example). I will  
      compile and run the source code to the best of my machines limits, so be aware that I might not catch any runtime errors
      that might be missed by the compiler.
