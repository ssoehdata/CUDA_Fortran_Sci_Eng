This chapter focusses on coding styles and techniques for reducing the effort involved 
in porting applications to CUDA Fortran. 

One aim in porting over to Cuda Fortran is to leave the GPU code intact so that the same source code 
can be compiled to run on either the CPU or GPU  by the omission or addition of the -cuda compiler option. 




Several ported larger code examples were created by the authors than included here.
