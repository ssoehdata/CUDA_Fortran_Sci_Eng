This chapter on synchronization focuses on CUDA Fortran's syncrhonization features.
Specfically, syncrhonization refers to operations running in parallel. Synchronization between the host thread, kernels and data transfers between the host and device are addressed.
Additionally, syncrhonization between device threads running within a kernel, incl. barrier synchronization, memory fences, and the cooperative groups feauture in the CUDA Toolkit are covered.
