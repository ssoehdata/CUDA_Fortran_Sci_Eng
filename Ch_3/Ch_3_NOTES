This chapter covers timing of code sections on the GPU via a variety of approaches including;
    - instrumenting the code with CPU and GPU timers
    - using tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Compute

    Also covered is how timing information can be used to determine the limiting factor 
    of kernel execution. 

    In addition, performance metric calculations methods, in particular as related to bandwidth as
    well as the interpretation of such metrics are covered.
