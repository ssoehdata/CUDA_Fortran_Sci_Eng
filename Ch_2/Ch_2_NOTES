This chapter addresses verification for correctness of the results obtained from the GPU. 
Two aspects are discussed: 
	- the first concerns numerical accuracy issues inherent in any floating-point computation 
          performed in parallel, as well as some compiler flags, which affect numerical accuracy on the GPU.
          
        - the second concerns programming errors and tools, such as cuda-memcheck and cuda-gdb, that can aid in error  correction.
